# Web Media API Gap Report

This folder contains the Gap reports for most relevant Web Media APIs. The Gap report for each API is available in a subfolder with the corresponding name. The main file in each folder is `index.html`. It uses the Gap report template developed by Francois Daoust [@tidoust](https://github.com/tidoust) (Thanks a lot Francois!). Please refer to `Test coverage` section. This folder is also served via github.io static web server and the content can be browsed via https://cta-wave.github.io/WMAS2017/. 

PS: Some of the large APIs like CSS and HTML are excluded from the list and may be considered in the future.
